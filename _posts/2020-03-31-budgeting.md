This is a web app built for someone who wants to keep track of their money! Its a
CRUD application and the user gets 5 categories to choose their spending type:

- Academics
- Food
- Transportation
- Clothes
- Miscellaneous Expenses

The user can also keep track of distribution of his/her spending through a portfolio or a comprehensive analysis using bar chart.
