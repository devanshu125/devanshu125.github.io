---

This is a web app built for someone who wants to keep track of their money! Its a
CRUD application and the user gets 5 categories to choose their spending type:

- Academics📚
- Food🍕
- Transportation✈️
- Clothes👕
- Miscellaneous Expenses👓

The user can also keep track of distribution of his/her spending through a portfolio or a comprehensive analysis using bar chart.

Here's a short [video](https://youtu.be/_hMlUxm6W6I) if you want to see my project in live action. Alternatively, you can see the web app in live action by watching this video👇
