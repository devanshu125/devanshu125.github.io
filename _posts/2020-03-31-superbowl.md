This is my first Data Science project after learning a thing or two about Data Manipulation. Here I load, clean and explore Super Bowl data.

Some of the questions I look at: -
- What are the most extreme game outcomes?
- How does the game affect television viewership?
- How has viewership, TV ratings and ad cost evolved over time?
- Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The dataset used in this project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with [game data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions), one with [TV data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_television_ratings) and one with [halftime musician data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows) for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.

I would like to thank [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) for building such things so that its easier for students just start with projects after a course on Intermediate Python for Data Science.

I have also written a blog post explaining about this project in detail, which you can find [here](https://devanshu125.blogspot.com/2020/01/tv-halftime-shows-and-big-game.html).
