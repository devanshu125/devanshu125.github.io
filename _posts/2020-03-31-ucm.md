This is a project based on handling a student's university courses data efficiently. I have used the concept of Data File Handling in C++ to make this project. The features of this project are:
- Add one or more courses to the course list that is append.
- Modifying the course details of a course already entered by the student.
- Searching a specific course's details entered by the student.
- Deleting a course entered by the user.
- Displaying all the courses entered by the student.
