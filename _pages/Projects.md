This section gives a short introduction about all my projects. The detailed explanation have been posted as blogs and the links have been attached in the respective summaries.

## 1. CS50 Final Project: Budgeting💰
This was my Final Project for the course CS50's Introduction to Computer Science
by Harvard University. Its a web app built for someone who wants to manage their money.

## 2. TV, Halftime Shows and the Big Game🏈
This is my first Data Science project after learning a thing or two about Data Manipulation. Here I load, clean and explore Super Bowl data. I try to visualize various things like extreme game outcomes or how does the game affect television viewership. To view my blog, click [here](https://devanshu125.github.io/superbowl/).


## 3. University Course Manager📝
I worked on this project in High School. Its my first "Computer Science" project. I built it using C++ and used the concept of Classes and Data File Handling. This project is based on handling a student's university courses data efficiently. To view a detailed explanation, click [here](https://devanshu125.github.io/ucm/).
