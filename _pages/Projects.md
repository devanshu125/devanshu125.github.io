This section gives a short Introduction about all my projects. The detailed
explanation have been posted as blogs. If you wish to read that, you can click

# 1. Budgeting
This was my Final Project for the course CS50's Introduction to Computer Science
by Harvard University. Its a web app built for someone who wants to manage their money.

# 2. TV, Halftime Shows and the Big Game
This is my first Data Science project after learning a thing or two about Data Manipulation. Here I load, clean and explore Super Bowl data. I try to visualize various things like extreme game outcomes or how does the game affect television viewership.

# 3. University Course Manager
I worked on this project in High School. Its my first "Computer Science" project.
I built it using C++ and used the concept of Classes and Data File Handling.
This project is based on handling a student's university courses data efficiently.
