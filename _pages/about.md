I'm a freshman at NMIMS University pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Data Science.

My technical skills include -

1. Programming Languages
  - Python
  I learnt about Python in the course CS50's Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University and never looked back. Its been an amazing experience coding in Python and I have also done some projects in Python including projects based on Data Science using technologies like Jupyter Notebook.

  - C and C++
  C++ was the first language I learnt. Pursued it further by opting for Computer Science in High School and oh boy, what a journey it was! Made a project on the way and now I'm fully into it when it comes competitve programming. About C, learnt that in CS50 as well, a very robust language and as David Malan (instructor of CS50) said, with great power comes great responsibily!

2. Web Technologies and Databases
  - HTML and CSS
  Picked this up in the Web track of CS50. After all that's how I'm making this website and also solved a problem set of making a website in CS50.

  - Flask
  One of the best things I have seen, intersection of HTML and Python at its best. Again, learnt this in the Web track of CS50 and implemented my final project using this framework. More on that in the Projects section.

  - SQLite3 and MySQL
  I learnt MySQL in High School and SQLite3 in CS50. These two have helped me a lot in understanding the fundamentals in Database Management Systems and I also used SQLite3 for implementing the database for CS50's final project.
