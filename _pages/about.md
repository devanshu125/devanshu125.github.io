Hello, world👋. This section is all about what I've been doing since the past few years.

## What have I been up to?
1. 🎓 I'm a freshman at NMIMS University studying Data Science.
2. 💻 I have been programming since the past few years and have proficient knowledge in
C, C++ and Python. Web Technologies include HTML, CSS and Flask and Databases, MySQL
and SQLite3. You can also check out a few [projects](https://devanshu125.github.io/Projects/) which I have done.
3. ✍️ On this website and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devanshu125/), I write articles on Data Science. Mostly its about [mini-projects](https://devanshu125.github.io/sharperatio/) and the [projects](https://devanshu125.github.io/Projects/) which I do or my understanding about a core concept, for example [Natural Language Processing](https://devanshu125.github.io/nlp1/). Please [follow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devanshu125/) me if that sounds interesting.

## Other stuff
1. 🎒 I've done my schooling from Indian School Al Wadi Al Kabir, Muscat, Oman. That's where I first found my love for Statistics.
2. ⚽ I enjoy playing football and I'm a huge fan of Manchester United, hence the Old Trafford photo on top (P.S. that's the UEFA Champions League Quarter Final vs. Barcelona).
