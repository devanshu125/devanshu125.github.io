You can find my Resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DS5kZvYx1y1DX05KakxDO_KayGes0vPd/view?usp=sharing).

I'm a freshman at NMIMS University pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Data Science.
I have been programming since the past few years and have proficient knowledge in
C, C++ and Python. Web Technologies include HTML, CSS and Flask and Databases, MySQL
and SQLite3. I have picked up most of these in a course called CS50's Introduction
to Computer Science by Harvard University.

I've done my schooling from Indian School Al Wadi Al Kabir, Muscat, Oman. Also,
I'm a huge fan of Manchester United, hence the Old Trafford photo (P.S. that's
the UEFA Champions League Quarter Final vs. Barcelona).
